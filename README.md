This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: creating multiple mutable borrows of the same variable.  The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to create two mutable references (`y` and `z`) to the same variable `x`. This violates Rust's ownership and borrowing rules, resulting in a compile-time error. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version that demonstrates a solution by using cloning or other strategies to avoid the conflict.
